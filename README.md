# Varaamo

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/City-of-Helsinki/varaamo.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/City-of-Helsinki/varaamo)

User interface for the City of Helsinki [varaamo.hel.fi](https://varaamo.hel.fi/) resource reservation service. Uses the [respa API](http://api.hel.fi/respa/v1/).

Check out the next version of Varaamo at https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/tilavarauspalvelu-ui

## Prerequicites

- [node](http://nodejs.org/) `>=14` | Suggestion: `14.8.1`
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Architecture

- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) handles the state management of the app. For more info check their awesome [docs](http://redux.js.org/).
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) handles the rendering of the 'views'.
- [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) is used to connect the Redux Store to React components.
- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) handles the routing of the app.
- [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) is used for getting data from Redux Store and manipulating it to be better usable in React components.
- [redux-api-middleware](https://github.com/agraboso/redux-api-middleware) is used to interact with the API.
- The application is run on an [express](http://expressjs.com/) server.
- Uses [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) and [Passport-Helsinki](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/passport-helsinki) for authentication.
- [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transforms JavaScript written in ES2015 and JSX syntax to regular JavaScript.

## Usage

### Starting dockerized development server

1. Check if Docker and docker CLI installed, port `3000` is free, not occupied by running server.

2. Make sure you have env variables in `.env`, otherwise extend it from example by:
   ```
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start building docker image and start container:
   ```
   $ docker-compose up
   ```
4. Open `localhost:3000` on browser when Webpack bundling is ready.

### Starting local development server

Follow the instructions below to set up the development environment.
By default the running app can be found at `localhost:3000`.

1. Install npm dependencies:

   ```
   $ yarn install
   ```

2. Make sure you have the following env variables set in an .env file in the root of the project:
   Run command:

   ```
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

   OR prepare .env with default content:

   ```
   CLIENT_ID
   CLIENT_SECRET
   SESSION_SECRET
   TARGET_APP
   API_URL
   CUSTOM_MUNICIPALITY_OPTIONS
   TIME_ZONE
   ```

   Environment's variable guideline:

   - `API_URL`:
     Custom config to replace global application's api URL. Expected value is valid URL string.

   - `CUSTOM_MUNICIPALITY_OPTIONS`:
     Config for custom municipalities. Expected value should be array of cities: `['Tampere','Jyväskylä','Oulu']`.

     Without this config, default to use 3 central cities Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa as options.

   - `TIME_ZONE`:
     The time zone of your resources. Bookings and calendars will be shown with this time zone no matter what the end users' browser is configured for. Defaults to Europe/Helsinki.

3. Then, start the development server:

   ```
   $ yarn start
   ```

### Starting production server

Follow the instructions below to build and start production server.
By default the running app uses port `8080`.

1. Install npm dependencies:

   ```
   $ yarn install
   ```

2. Build the production bundle:

   ```
   $ yarn build
   ```

3. Make sure you have the required env variables set.

4. Then, start the production server:

   ```
   $ yarn start:production
   ```

### Running tests

- Run tests:

  ```
  $ yarn test
  ```

- Run tests in watch mode:

  ```
  $ yarn test:watch
  ```

- Run tests with coverage:

  ```
  $ yarn test:coverage
  ```

### Running code linter

- To check the code for linting errors:

  ```
  $ yarn lint
  ```

- To automate fixing lint:

      ```
      $ yarn lint:fix
      ```

  OR enable `eslint --fix` onSave config in your code editor config.

### Useful docker command

- To rebuild the docker images:
  ```
  $ docker-compose up --force-recreate --build
  ```
- To enter inside docker container environment:
  ```
  $ docker-compose exec web sh
  ```
- Remove docker container if needed:
  ```
  $ docker rm -f varaamo-frontend
  ```
- Remove docker image:
  ```
  $ docker rmi varaamo_web
  ```
- Running command inside Docker environment (test for example):
  (Make sure docker container is running)
  `$ docker-compose run web YOUR_COMMAND_HERE`
- Encounter `node-sass` issue ? try to go inside docker container environment and run `npm rebuild node-sass`

## Code style and linting

The code mostly follows the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
All JavaScript should be written in ES2015 syntax.
Code is automatically linted with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) when running unit tests or bundling the app with webpack.

## Styles and Stylesheets

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS extension language is used to make writing styles nicer. [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) handles CSS vendor prefixes.
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used as the CSS framework for the site and [City of Helsinki Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/hel-bootstrap-3) is used as the main theme.

## Testing framework

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for running the tests and for test assertions. Running on [Jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) environment by default, which was a headless browser.
- [simple-mock](https://github.com/jupiter/simple-mock) and [MockDate](https://github.com/boblauer/MockDate) are used for mocking and spies.
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) is used to make testing React Components easier.

## Running Vscode debugger

All setting was included under .vscode directory.

- On Chrome:
  [Guideline](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code). Setting was under `Vscode debugger` name
- On Jest test:
  [Guideline](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/troubleshooting#debugging-in-vs-code). Setting was under `Vscode Jest debugger` name.

  - Put breakpoint in test file `(*.test.js)`

  - Run command:

  ```
  $ yarn test:debug
  ```
